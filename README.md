## How can I get a random theme?

## How can I get two contrasting colors?

You can use this list!

Each item contains a background and 5 colors that should go well with it.

```js
const ThemeList = ....

let theme = ThemeList[random_number]
let background_color = theme.background
let text_color = theme[`color_${other_random_number}`]
```
