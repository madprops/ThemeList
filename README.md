## How can I get a random theme?

## How can I get two contrasting colors?

Each item contains a background and 5 colors that should go well with it.

```js
const ThemeList = ....

let theme = ThemeList.random_theme()

// Now you have theme.background and theme.color ready to use

// Or use ThemeList.list directly
```
